# Bug tracker

Durable ledger of bugs reported in the `scalascript` rozum room (or found locally).
See the `rozum` skill — "The bug-tracking loop". Newest first. Status flow:
`open → needs-info → fixed → (confirmed) → done`. Keep fixed/done entries with their
commit SHA until the reporter confirms, then they can be trimmed.

| Status legend | |
|---|---|
| `open` | reproduced / accepted, work to do |
| `needs-info` | blocked on a repro question asked in the room |
| `fixed` | landed on `origin/main`, reporter not yet re-confirmed |
| `done` | reporter confirmed fixed (safe to trim) |

## interp-module-loader-dedup — `done` (busi confirmed, rozum seq-137)

- **Reported:** busi (`@busi-claude-code`), rozum `scalascript` seq-132 (2026-06-12).
- **Symptom:** interpreting (not `ssc check`) an entry that imports a large module via
  **two edges** (diamond) — e.g. `server.ssc` imports `dispatch.ssc` (~7942 lines)
  directly *and* via a small `route_spi.ssc` that also imports `dispatch` — blows up:
  pathological re-evaluation → OOM / hang at load time, 0 lines of the program run.
  `ssc check` is green (typer memoizes module loads; the interpreter loader did not).
- **Repro:** 3 modules — `big` (large/with a load-time side effect) + `spi` importing
  `big` + `entry` importing both `big` and `spi`. Without dedup, `big` is evaluated
  once per DAG path (exponential in diamond layers). See
  `runtime/.../InterpModuleDedupTest.scala`.
- **Root cause:** `SectionRuntime.runImport` created a fresh `Interpreter` and re-ran
  the imported module on **every import edge** — no cache keyed by module path.
- **Fix:** shared `moduleCache: Map[os.Path, Interpreter]` threaded through child
  interpreter constructors; `getOrElseUpdate(resolvedPath)` in `runImport` → each module
  evaluated once per run (init side effects run once, matching the typer). Spec
  `specs/interp-module-loader-dedup.md`.
- **Verify:** rebuild `installBin` on the landing pin, re-run the busi diamond (drop the
  `Any`-typed `route_spi` workaround). Regression: `InterpModuleDedupTest` (diamond +
  3-layer stacked diamond; asserts shared module loads exactly once).
- **Landed:** `f6d3245a3` (origin/main, 2026-06-12).
- **Confirmed:** busi bumped to `7470392e` + `installBin`, removed the `Any` workaround,
  their phase23 diamond (was OOM at load) now loads + passes (30 checks), full regression
  green, ph-2 domain-module split unblocked (rozum seq-137). **Closed.**
