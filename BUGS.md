# Bug tracker

Durable ledger of bugs reported in the `scalascript` rozum room (or found locally).
See the `rozum` skill — "The bug-tracking loop". Newest first. Status flow:
`open → needs-info → fixed → (confirmed) → done`. Keep fixed/done entries with their
commit SHA until the reporter confirms, then they can be trimmed.

| Status legend | |

## interp-cons-in-effect-handler — `open` (2026-06-13)

- **Found:** by me, while expanding `ExamplesSmokeTest` run coverage
  (`examples/algebraic-effects.ssc` fails to run). Reproduces on `origin/main`
  (`bb580815c`) via the in-process interpreter AND the fat-jar `bin/ssc`.
- **CORRECTION (earlier mis-diagnosis):** this is **not** a general `::`
  right-associativity bug. `::` is right-associative and works fine on its own —
  `"a" :: List("b")` → `List(a, b)`, `1 :: 2 :: List(3)` → `List(1, 2, 3)`, and even
  `def build(m, rest) = m :: rest; build("x", List("y"))` → `List(x, y)` all work. The
  original filed repro (`build(...)`) does **not** reproduce. Apologies to the next
  agent — verify against the corrected repro below.
- **Symptom (actual):** `msg :: rest` errors `No method '::' on StringV(...)` **only when
  the right operand is the result of a continuation call** `resume(())` inside a `handle`
  case. `msg :: List("end")` in the *same* handler works. So the right operand of a
  right-associative operator, when it is a `resume(())` result, is not resolved to its
  concrete `ListV` at the point `::` dispatches → the interpreter falls back to dispatching
  `::` on the **left** operand (the String) and fails. This is an **effects-CPS /
  resume-result interaction** in the interpreter's operator dispatch, not parsing.
- **Repro (needs a `handle` block):**
  ```scalascript
  effect Logger:
    def log(msg: String): Unit
  def greet(): Unit ! Logger = Logger.log("Hello")
  val messages = handle(greet()) {
    case Logger.log(msg, resume) =>
      val rest = resume(())   // continuation result
      msg :: rest             // ERROR: No method '::' on StringV(Hello)
  }
  println(messages)           // expected List(Hello)
  ```
- **Control (works):** replace `val rest = resume(())` with `resume(()); val rest =
  List("end")` → prints `List(Hello, end)`. Confirms it's the `resume`-result operand,
  not `::` itself.
- **Note:** deep + narrow (right-assoc ops on a `resume(())` result in a handler — and
  possibly any method that must dispatch on the right operand). Fix lives in the interp's
  effect/CPS value resolution: a `resume(())` result must be forced to its concrete Value
  before it is used as a right-associative operand. Risky — needs effects-runtime care +
  cross-backend check (does jvm/js CPS lowering share it?). Lower priority: `::` directly
  on a continuation result is an uncommon pattern.

## interp-toString-on-collection — `fixed` (2026-06-13, `225aacc18`)

- **Fixed:** intercept `toString` (0-arg) at the top of `DispatchRuntime.dispatch`
  (alongside the `asInstanceOf` early-return) → render via `Value.show`, the canonical
  println / string-interpolation path, so `x.toString == s"$x"` for every value. A
  case-class instance with a user-defined `toString` method keeps it (checked via
  `lookupTypeMethod` first). Needed to intercept at the TOP because type-specific
  dispatchers mis-handle the name first (`map.toString` → key lookup → "No key
  'toString'"). Interp-only fix (JVM/JS codegen emit native `toString`). Regress:
  `BugReproTest` (list render + composite canonical-render invariant across
  List/Map/tuple/Option/case-class); 65 `.toString`-dependent tests across 7 suites
  green; `examples/async-parallel-demo.ssc` now runs end-to-end.
- **Found:** by me, expanding `ExamplesSmokeTest` (`examples/async-parallel-demo.ssc`
  fails). Reproduces on `origin/main` (`e73fd9a73`) via the interpreter.
- **Symptom:** `.toString` is universal in Scala (every value has it) but the
  interpreter has no `.toString` dispatch for a `ListV` (and likely other collection /
  composite Values) → `No method 'toString' on ListV(List(50, 50, 50))`.
- **Repro:**
  ```scalascript
  val xs = List(50, 50, 50)
  println("result=" + xs.toString)   // No method 'toString' on ListV
  ```
- **Note:** broadly useful, likely small — add a universal `.toString` fallback in the
  interpreter's method dispatch (render via the same path as `println`/string-concat).
  Check Map/Set/tuple/Option/Either too. Cross-backend regression.

## interp-typed-data-not-callable — `open` (2026-06-13)

- **Found:** by me, expanding `ExamplesSmokeTest` (`examples/typed-data.ssc` fails).
  Reproduces on `origin/main` (`e73fd9a73`).
- **Symptom:** `ssc run examples/typed-data.ssc` errors `[line 11, col 35] Not callable:
  ()` — something in the typed-data showcase evaluates to `Unit` and is then applied as
  a function. Needs narrowing to the exact construct (case-class default param? a tuple
  accessor? a block returning Unit used in call position). Lower priority — single
  example, not a known common pattern.

## js-self-handling-cps-fn-not-run — `fixed` (2026-06-12)

- **Fixed:** `JsGen.runIfEffectful` wraps a non-CPS-context call to an effectful
  function in `_run`, so a self-handling CPS fn's lazy `_FlatMap` resolves at the
  value boundary (`println(workload())`). `_run` is idempotent on an already-resolved
  plain value (so a direct-runner result like `_handleOneShot(…)` is unaffected) and
  throws loudly on an unhandled effect; CPS-context calls go through `genCpsApply`,
  never `genApply`, so they're untouched. Verified via node: non-loop self-handling →
  3, multi-shot handled-in-while → 204, one-shot regression → 5. backendInterpreter 1678
  green. Regress: `JsEffectLoopTest` (self-handling + multi-shot). **effect-multishot now
  runs on JS.** Diagnosis below.
- **Found:** while landing `effect-cps-loops-js` (the perform-in-while lowering).
- **Symptom:** on the **JS backend only**, a function that handles its OWN effects
  internally (so it has no unresolved `perform`) but is still CPS-emitted (because its
  body contains `handle`/effect machinery) returns an **un-run lazy `_FlatMap`**. A
  value-position call to it (`println(workload())`) prints `[object Object]` instead of
  the result. Blocks the `effect-multishot` corpus on JS (and any self-handling block).
- **Repro (JS only; jvm + interp are correct):**
  ```scalascript
  multi effect NonDet:
    def choose(options: List[Int]): Int
  def program(): Int ! NonDet =
    val a = NonDet.choose(List(1, 2, 3))
    a
  def workload(): Int =
    val all = handle(program()) { case NonDet.choose(opts, resume) => opts.flatMap(opt => resume(opt)) }
    all.length
  println(workload())   // JS: prints [object Object]; expected 3
  ```
  Note: NO `while` needed — this is **not** a perform-in-loop bug; the `while` fix is
  orthogonal. `effect-oneshot` (where `workload` is a *direct* `handle(...)` → a runner
  call → plain value) works on JS.
- **Root cause:** JS `_bind(c, f)` is **always lazy** (`return new _FlatMap(c, f)`),
  unlike JVM's `_bind` which is eager on a non-`Perform` value. A CPS'd self-handling
  function's chain has no `Perform` nodes, so on JVM it eager-resolves to a plain value,
  but on JS it stays a lazy `_FlatMap` that nothing runs at the (non-CPS) call site.
- **Verified fix hypothesis:** wrapping the value-position call in `_run` resolves it
  (`_run(workload())` → 3 / 12 / 204). The fix is to emit `_run(...)` at a non-CPS value
  boundary for a call whose result is a CPS'd (effectful) function — `_run` is idempotent
  on plain values, so it's safe for the direct-runner case too. Needs care in `genApply`
  to avoid wrapping calls that are themselves inside a CPS context (those go through
  `genCpsApply`). HIGH-ish risk — gate on the full effect suite + node tests.
- **Status:** open. The `effect-cps-loops-js` perform-in-while lowering landed without
  it; `effect-multishot` stays `n/a` on JS until this is fixed.

## interp-module-loader-dedup — `done` (busi confirmed, rozum seq-137)

- **Reported:** busi (`@busi-claude-code`), rozum `scalascript` seq-132 (2026-06-12).
- **Symptom:** interpreting (not `ssc check`) an entry that imports a large module via
  **two edges** (diamond) — e.g. `server.ssc` imports `dispatch.ssc` (~7942 lines)
  directly *and* via a small `route_spi.ssc` that also imports `dispatch` — blows up:
  pathological re-evaluation → OOM / hang at load time, 0 lines of the program run.
  `ssc check` is green (typer memoizes module loads; the interpreter loader did not).
- **Repro:** 3 modules — `big` (large/with a load-time side effect) + `spi` importing
  `big` + `entry` importing both `big` and `spi`. Without dedup, `big` is evaluated
  once per DAG path (exponential in diamond layers). See
  `runtime/.../InterpModuleDedupTest.scala`.
- **Root cause:** `SectionRuntime.runImport` created a fresh `Interpreter` and re-ran
  the imported module on **every import edge** — no cache keyed by module path.
- **Fix:** shared `moduleCache: Map[os.Path, Interpreter]` threaded through child
  interpreter constructors; `getOrElseUpdate(resolvedPath)` in `runImport` → each module
  evaluated once per run (init side effects run once, matching the typer). Spec
  `specs/interp-module-loader-dedup.md`.
- **Verify:** rebuild `installBin` on the landing pin, re-run the busi diamond (drop the
  `Any`-typed `route_spi` workaround). Regression: `InterpModuleDedupTest` (diamond +
  3-layer stacked diamond; asserts shared module loads exactly once).
- **Landed:** `f6d3245a3` (origin/main, 2026-06-12).
- **Confirmed:** busi bumped to `7470392e` + `installBin`, removed the `Any` workaround,
  their phase23 diamond (was OOM at load) now loads + passes (30 checks), full regression
  green, ph-2 domain-module split unblocked (rozum seq-137). **Closed.**
