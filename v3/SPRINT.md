# ScalaScript 3 — sprint

Queue for the **`v3/`** module. Two states and no third: `[~]` in progress, `[x]` done.
Not-started work belongs in [`BACKLOG.md`](BACKLOG.md).

Design: [`specs/00-charter.md`](specs/00-charter.md) · [`specs/10-ssc-ir.md`](specs/10-ssc-ir.md).
Pipeline: `source → AST → SSC IR → execute | translate`.

**The order is deliberate: the IR is designed and verified before a front is written against it.**
A compiler built on an IR that turns out to be wrong is work thrown away twice.

## ssc3-core (claim `ssc3-core`)

- [~] **SSC3-0 — charter, IR spec, module.** `v3/` registered in `tests/fixtures/modules.tsv`;
      `specs/00-charter.md`, `10-ssc-ir.md`, `20-core-language.md`, `30-portable-subset.md`; boards.
      *Done when:* the four specs exist and the IR spec fixes the instruction set, the validation
      rules and the canonical text form.

- [ ] **SSC3-1 — `Array` into the portable subset, fixed on every lane v3 targets.**
      Found by measurement while scoping SSC3-0 and blocking: the IR frame *is* an array.
      `new Array[Int](3).length` is `1` on both lanes today — [`../BUGS.md`](../BUGS.md) →
      `new-array-n-builds-a-one-element-array`, filed at the root because `lane: multi` was
      measured rather than assumed and the fix is not in `v3/`.
      Re-measure the whole inherited gap map (`specs/uniml-portable-gapmap.md`, 2026-07-13) before
      writing kernel sources against it.
      *Gate:* `v3/tests/array-floor.ssc` asserts length, indexed read/write past index 0, and
      `Array.fill`; run on int, js, jvm and v2. **Must be observed failing first** — record the red
      count in the commit (P-6.1). Compare output, never the exit code.

- [ ] **SSC3-2 — IR core: data model, verifier, canonical text form.** In the portable subset.
      `Module`/`Func`/`Instr` per the spec; the verifier's five checks; `.ssir` reader and writer.
      *Gate:* round-trip as a property (`read(write(m)) == m`, `write(read(t)) == t`), plus a
      planted-defect suite — one malformed module per validation rule, each rejected naming the
      failing instruction path. A verifier that has never refused anything is untested.

- [ ] **SSC3-3 — the executor.** The register VM: frame allocation, the instruction loop, structured
      branch handling, `TailCall` frame reuse, `Prim` dispatch. `ssc3 run-ir <file.ssir>`.
      *Gate:* hand-written `.ssir` programs covering every opcode, expected output checked in;
      a tail-recursive loop of 10^7 iterations completing in constant stack is part of it, since
      that is the stability claim.

- [ ] **SSC3-4 — the front.** Lexer (own character tables, no host classification), parser, AST,
      lowering to IR for SSC3 core Tier 0 (`specs/20-core-language.md` §2).
      *Gate:* `ssc3 run` on a growing case set; every construct in Tier 0 has one.

- [ ] **SSC3-5 — `bin/ssc3`, the honest number, the differential gate.**
      CLI: `run`, `ir` (print `.ssir`), `check` (verify only), `build --target`.
      `v3/corpus-report.sh` publishing `N/381` in the four buckets of `specs/20-core-language.md` §3,
      gated on non-regression of `N`.
      `v3/portable-diff.sh` — front built by scalac vs the same sources run on ScalaScript 2, IR
      compared byte for byte (invariant I-3).
      *Gate:* both harnesses observed failing on a planted defect before either is trusted.

Sergiy uses `bin/ssc3` from **SSC3-3** onward (hand-written IR) and for real programs from
**SSC3-4**. Everything before that is apparatus.
