# SclJet — sprint

This module's queue. **Two states, and there is no third:**

    - [~] SLUG — one line      in progress
    - [x] SLUG — one line      done

Anything not being worked on belongs in `scljet/BACKLOG.md`, not here — a queue with a
"planned" state just becomes a second backlog. A task being worked on also has a row on
the root `SPRINT.md` board and a live `.work/active/<slug>.claim`; all three are written
in one commit. Layout: `specs/work-tracking-layout.md`.

_Nothing in progress._
