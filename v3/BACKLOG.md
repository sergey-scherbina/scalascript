# ScalaScript 3 — backlog

Work that can wait, and **alternatives that were considered and parked with their trade-offs**
(P-4.2). A parked alternative costs nothing and is there the day it becomes right; the same
alternative held as "I should ask about this someday" is lost at the next reboot.

## Parked design alternatives

- **Flat basic blocks + SSA instead of structured regions.** Rejected for
  [`specs/10-ssc-ir.md`](specs/10-ssc-ir.md) §2: source-language output is a stated requirement, and
  recovering loops from a block graph is the relooper problem. Becomes right if v3 ever grows an
  optimizer whose passes genuinely need SSA and dominance — the conversion is then a *pass* on a
  module, not a change of the canonical form. Note the cost honestly: some classical optimizations
  (global value numbering, aggressive code motion) are meaningfully harder on regions.

- **A stack machine instead of a register machine.** More compact encoding and a simpler emitter;
  rejected because interpretation pays push/pop per operand and native lowering needs registers
  anyway. Reconsider only if `.ssirb` size ever becomes a real constraint.

- **Typed IR.** `kind` currently carries only what the front proved. A fully typed IR would let the
  verifier reject far more, and would let backends emit unboxed primitives directly. Blocked on
  v3 having a type checker at all; the `kind` field is the forward-compatible seam.

- **Reusing v2's Core IR so v3 inherits its backends.** Rejected: it would tie a linear register IR
  to a term tree and give up the property the version exists for. The backends are re-earned from
  the new IR instead — cheaply, because structured control flow makes source emission direct.

## Deferred capability

- Separate compilation — a module is a whole program in v1 of the IR.
- Garbage collection — values are host objects.
- Effects and handlers in the **front**. The IR reserves `Perform` / `Handle` / `Resume`, so this is
  a front gap rather than a representation gap; that is the whole reason they are in the instruction
  set from day one.
- Tier 2 language surface: implicits and `given`/`using`, macros, typeclass derivation
  ([`specs/20-core-language.md`](specs/20-core-language.md) §2).
- `.ssirb` binary form — `.ssir` text is canonical and sufficient until artifact size or load time
  is measured to be a problem.
- Backends beyond the executor: JVM bytecode, JS, Rust, Swift source. Each is a `Module → Artifact`
  function; none is scheduled until the IR has stopped moving.
