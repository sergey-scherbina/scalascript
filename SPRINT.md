# Sprint

Agent task queue — **active pending tasks only**. A task is "available" only if
`.work/active/<slug>.claim` does not exist on `origin/main`. Completed work lives in
`CHANGELOG.md`; open (not-yet-started) work lives in `BACKLOG.md`.

**Loop control** — pause: push `.work/paused` to `origin/main`; resume: remove it and push.
Start: tell the agent "go" / "работай". Status: ask "status" / "статус".

---

## Active tasks

Driven by the agreed roadmap (BACKLOG.md → "Roadmap — agreed priority order, 2026-06-17").
Work top-to-bottom, one major theme at a time. **Maven/centralized publication is LAST.**

### ▶ Prioritized build queue (2026-06-18, with Sergiy — "внеси всё и делай автономно")

The genuine remaining **autonomously-actionable** build work, in priority order. Drive top-to-bottom,
one theme at a time, per-feature worktrees + claims. Everything below the queue is either history (`[x]`)
or blocked/deferred (kept for record, NOT actionable now — see "Excluded from the sprint").

> **Status 2026-06-18 (autonomous pass):** queue worked top-to-bottom. #1 meta-v2-track-c —
> verified already complete (no build). #2 sbt-plugin dep-resolution — ✓ built + tested (residuals
> design-/Maven-gated). #3 wasm-effects — **effectively COMPLETE**: arithmetic (2a) + `_dispatch`
> collection-HOFs (2b) + multi-shot (2c) + cross-module (2d) all built + run-verified on node (36 tests);
> `@main` args/non-Unit edge later closed by `wasm-main-edge` (40 tests). #4 build-registry-phase4 — assessed, no concrete target → no
> action. Then `sscBackends` cross-build ✓ DONE (user picked spec open-Q #2 → parallel outputs in one
> `compile`; scripted `cross-build/`). **What remains is Maven-gated only:** Maven Central + Plugin Portal
> publication (LAST, explicit-go). No bounded autonomous build work left.

### ▶ Quality / perf queue (2026-06-20, with Sergiy — "все эти задачи занеси в спринт и начинай делать")

After the perf series (foldLeft VM compile + typeclass-fold memo) micro-throughput is at the floor. The
next autonomously-actionable work is quality + unmeasured-axis perf, priority order. Drive top-to-bottom,
per-feature worktrees + claims.

> **Status 2026-06-20 (queue worked top-to-bottom — ALL DONE):** #1 real-workload-perf ✓ all three axes:
> (a) cold-start AppCDS −51% + harness, (b)+(c) steady-state server RSS+GC harness (~195 MB STABLE, no leak).
> #2 xbackend full+CI ✓ generator already broad (12 kinds) + wired into CI. #3 xbackend-test-hardening ✓
> `runCaptured` hang-proof runner. #4 rust-web-toolkit ✓ verified essentially complete + shipped the one
> bounded deferred slice (set/toggle client wiring); rest is browser/rozum-driven. **Queue fully resolved.**
> Follow-ups also DONE 2026-06-20 (per "сделай всё кроме maven"): **xbackend hang-proof sweep** — converted
> all 17 deadlock-risk (both-streams) subprocess-test files to `ProcTestUtil.runOrThrow`/`runCaptured` (the
> 22 single-stream `redirectErrorStream` files are deadlock-safe + behaviour-subtle → left as-is, standard
> set for new tests); 54 converted tests run green. **Server leak-hunt** — 4-min sustained-load run:
> definitively no leak (RSS peaked 205 MB, *ended 80 MB* as the JVM reclaimed heap; GC light/steady). **Only
> Maven publication (gated, excluded) + rozum/browser-driven rust refinements remain.**

### ▶ Rust-web computed-signal queue (2026-06-20, with Sergiy — "делай всё, заноси в спринт и делай")

The rust-web S5 refinements turned out to be autonomously buildable + curl/cargo-verifiable (set/toggle,
SSE, computed-read compile+SSR all DONE). Remaining, priority order:

- [x] **computed-live-recompute** ✓ DONE 2026-06-20 — computed signals are now fully reactive. Moved the
      signal store to `value.rs` (so `signal_value` can read it) + a computed-closure registry +
      `ssc_register_computed`/`ssc_recompute_all`; `_ui_computed_signal` is a re-runnable `Fn` returning a
      NAMED signal; `/__ssc/push` recomputes before broadcasting (SSE). **Verified cargo+curl:** push a dep →
      the computed signal auto-updates (`{"__c0":"fr"}` → `{"__c0":"de"}`). `backendRust` 224/0.
- [x] **computed-typed-reads** ✓ DONE 2026-06-20 — `collectLocalSignals` carries the element type; the apply
      emits `.parse::<i64>()`/`.parse::<f64>()` for `Signal[Int]`/`[Double]`, `.show()` for String. Verified:
      `signal("n", 10)` + `n() + 5` → `15`. `backendRust` 225/0.
- [x] **direct-WS** ✓ DONE 2026-06-20 — a `serve(view)` program also exposes a WS signal endpoint on
      `port + 1` for external clients (rozum bridge), bidirectional + sharing the SSE store/broadcast/recompute.
      `ssc_ws_serve` (accept_async) sends state on connect, streams updates, and an incoming `name=value` frame
      sets+recomputes. **Verified cargo + raw-WS client (python):** WS-push `locale=de` → `{"__c0":"de"}`.
      `backendRust` 226/0. **rust-web S5 now FULLY COMPLETE** (set/toggle, SSE, computed compile+SSR + live
      recompute, typed reads, direct-WS — all built + cargo/curl/WS-verified).

### ▶ Benchmark perf-divergence queue (2026-06-21, with Sergiy — "разбирайся в чем дела — в jit? В codegen? В bench?")

The big per-workload outliers from the same `./bench.sh` sweep, each ROOT-CAUSED by hand (emit + read the
generated code / toggle the JIT). Verdict per case: **codegen**, **jit**, or **bench** (intentional anti-fold).

- [ ] **rust-foreach-list-realloc** (CODEGEN — highest ROI) — `localList.foreach(f)` re-emits the collection
      **literal** instead of referencing the bound local, so inside a loop it RE-ALLOCATES the whole list every
      iteration + clones each element. Verified in plain `emit-rust` (no bench instrumentation):
      `pattern-match-heavy` → `while (i<100000) { for s in vec![Circle{..},Rect{..},..].iter().cloned() { total += area(s.clone()); } }` — the `let shapes = vec![..]` is emitted but DEAD; the `vec![5 shapes]` is rebuilt
      100 000×. `list-fold` is identical (`vec![1..10]` rebuilt 10 000×). Explains rust `pattern-match-heavy`
      **4.16 ms (68× the interpreter, 78× jvm)** and `list-fold` **0.153 ms (500× jvm)**. **Fix:** in
      `RustCodeWalk`, lower `recv.foreach`/`for`-over-a-bound-local to `for s in <recv>.iter()` (reference the
      binding, don't re-inline the ctor); drop `.cloned()` when the body only reads. **Verify:** the emitted
      loop iterates `shapes`/`xs`; `./bench.sh pattern-match-heavy list-fold --backend rust` drops by orders.
- [ ] **asm-jit-effect-pathology** (JIT) — `ssc-asm` = `ssc` with `SSC_JIT_BACKEND=asm`. On `effect-oneshot`
      the asm register-VM JIT is **225× slower than default `ssc`** in the bench (verified locally: default
      239 ms vs `SSC_JIT_BACKEND=asm` 1323 ms on a 200-rep run). The asm backend mis-handles the
      `perform → handle → resume` trampoline (the default backend bails to tree-walk on effectful loop bodies;
      the asm path apparently does not). **Fix:** make the asm JIT bail on an effectful loop body like the
      default backend does, or fix the asm lowering of the effect trampoline. **Verify:**
      `SSC_JIT_BACKEND=asm bin/ssc run` on an effect-in-loop is no worse than default.
- [ ] **js-tuple-monoid-alloc** (CODEGEN) — `js` `tuple-monoid` is the **slowest cell in the whole table
      (7.40 ms, 87× jvm)**. The emitted hot loop allocates + dispatches heavily PER ITERATION (×100 000):
      `_tupleConcat(Object.assign([(s%4)|0,2],{_isTuple:true}), Object.assign([3,4],{_isTuple:true}))` (3 array
      allocs + 2 `Object.assign`) then `acc = _arith('+', _arith('+', acc, _dispatch(t,'_1',[])), _dispatch(t,'_4',[]))`
      — tuple element reads go through runtime `_dispatch` and integer `+` through `_arith`. **Fix (JsGen):**
      emit a direct `t[0]`/`t[3]` for a static tuple-index `._N` access, native `+` for known-Int operands, and
      a cheaper tuple tag than `Object.assign(...,{_isTuple:true})`. **Verify:** the loop has no per-iter
      `_dispatch`/`_arith`/`Object.assign`; `./bench.sh tuple-monoid --backend js` drops.
- NOTE (no task — **bench**, intentional): rust `arith-loop` **1.52 ms (4.7× jvm)** is largely the harness's
      anti-fold — `run.sc` wraps every rust closure body + per-iter reassignment in `std::hint::black_box(...)`,
      blocking LLVM loop optimization (the comment at `run.sc:176` even tunes this so rust "stops looking 3–4×
      slower"). Not a codegen bug; leave as-is unless we want a lighter rust anti-fold.

### ▶ Benchmark backend-gap queue (2026-06-21, with Sergiy — "Запиши в спринт все n/a")

Every `n/a` from a full `./bench.sh` sweep (31 workloads × ssc/ssc-asm/jvm/js/rust), each VERIFIED by hand
against the current toolchain (the corpus comments were stale). The bench measures time only (no correctness
check — that's `CrossBackendPropertyTest`, green); `n/a` = that backend's emit/build/run failed.

- [ ] **rust-effects-handle-resume** (R.4.2) — `effect-oneshot` + `effect-multishot` are `n/a` on **rust**:
      `emit-rust` fails with `unsupported pattern: Pat.Extract` on the handler case (`Bump.tick(resume)` and
      `NonDet.choose(opts, resume)`). The rust backend does not lower custom-effect `handle`/`resume` IR at all
      (consistent with the R.4.2 gap — `effect.rs` is runtime-infra only, `RustCodeWalk` has no handle/resume
      case). **How:** add a `Pat.Extract` handler-case lowering + `resume` continuation in `RustCodeWalk`;
      start with one-shot (`resume(x)` once), then multi-shot (`resume` in a `flatMap`). **Verify:**
      `./bench.sh effect-oneshot effect-multishot --backend rust` no longer `n/a`; add a `backendRust` effect test.
- [ ] **jvm-multishot-result-type** — `effect-multishot` is `n/a` on **jvm** (one-shot is fine — see stale
      note below). The multi-shot `handle(program()) { case NonDet.choose(opts, resume) => opts.flatMap(resume) }`
      result is emitted with type `Any`, so a downstream collection op fails to compile:
      `[E008] value foldLeft is not a member of Any` (`all.foldLeft(0L)(...)`). **How:** in `JvmGen`/CPS
      transform, type the multi-shot handle result as the resume-collection type (`List[Int]`) instead of `Any`
      (or insert a cast). **Verify:** the wrapped `effect-multishot.ssc` workload runs on jvm; `./bench.sh
      effect-multishot --backend jvm` no longer `n/a`.
- [ ] **rust-either-chain-closure-type** (E0282) — `either-chain` is `n/a` on **rust**: `cargo build` fails
      `error[E0282]: type annotations needed` on a closure the chained-`Either` match emits —
      `move |x| { black_box(parse(x.clone())) }` — rustc can't infer `x`'s type through the nested
      `match match match … { Either::Left(v) => …, Either::Right(v) => (move |x| …)(v) }`. **How:** in
      `RustCodeWalk`, annotate the closure parameter type for an `Either`/`Option` map-step closure (the type
      is known from the prism arm), or bind the intermediate to a typed `let`. **Verify:** `./bench.sh
      either-chain --backend rust` builds + runs; add a `backendRust` either-chain codegen test.
- [ ] **bench-stale-jvm-na-hygiene** (bookkeeping) — `effect-oneshot` shows `n/a` for **jvm** in the bench,
      but the jvm backend RUNS it correctly now (verified: the real `effect-oneshot.ssc` workload → `OS=962` on
      both interp and jvm; `var`+`while`+`perform` jvm lowering landed earlier). The `n/a` is a stale artifact:
      the `bench/corpus/effect-oneshot.ssc` (and `effect-multishot.ssc`) header comments still say "jvm/js/rust
      n/a (2026-06-12)" though js + jvm one-shot now work. **How:** refresh the corpus comments to current
      status, and find why the bench's jvm leg returns `None` for effect-oneshot despite the workload compiling
      (likely a stale `.scjvm` cache or a wrapper-instrumentation mismatch) so the column reflects reality.

### ▶ Improvement queue (2026-06-20, with Sergiy — "занеси все в спринт и делай")

Fresh do-soon queue after rust-web S5 closed. Work top-to-bottom, one claim/worktree per slice. Maven Central
publication remains explicit-go only; the registry work below is intentionally domain-independent first.

- [x] **wasm-main-edge** ✓ DONE 2026-06-20 — closed the last WASM effects tail. Effectful WASM now derives
      the user `@main` from the AST, preserves a single Scala 3 `@main` parameter clause (including
      `String*` splicing), discards non-`Unit` returns in the synthetic wrapper, and rejects raw
      `Array[String]` `@main` args with a clear "use `String*`" diagnostic. **Verified:**
      `cd /Users/sergiy/work/my/scalascript/.worktrees/feature/wasm-main-edge && sbt "backendWasm/testOnly scalascript.codegen.WasmBackendTest"`
      → 40/40 green. Gotcha recorded in `specs/wasm-main-edge.md`: Scala.js ES-module launcher argument
      delivery is out of scope; a direct Node probe supplies empty `String*` args.
- [ ] **stable-plugin-spi-p3** — finish the remaining Phase 3 cleanup around stable plugin/SPI boundaries.
      **How:** read `specs/arch-stable-spi.md`; inventory direct `scalascript.interpreter.*` imports in
      `runtime/std/*/*Intrinsics.scala`; migrate one low-risk plugin or add a boundary/classpath regression
      that locks the intended rule. Keep this as small shippable slices, not a broad refactor. **Verify:**
      affected plugin tests plus the smallest relevant backend/interpreter suite.
- [x] **js-char-wrapper-string-map** ✓ DONE 2026-06-21 — added a JS `_Char` box (`JsRuntimePart2a`):
      `valueOf`→code point, `toString`→1-char string (so concat/arith/`_show` coerce). Iterated chars
      (`map`/`filter`/`foreach`/`flatMap`/`charAt`/`head`/`last`/`toList`/`forall`/`exists`/`count`) box;
      `String.map` returns a String only when every result is a `_Char`, else a Seq (mirrors `strMapResult`).
      `_dispatch` got a `_Char` branch mirroring the interp `dispatchChar` (`toInt`→code, `isDigit`/`toUpper`/
      `asDigit`/…); `_eq` bridges `_Char` ↔ 1-char String literal and ↔ Int. `CrossBackendPropertyTest`
      "String.map char vs non-char" now asserts interp == JS == JVM (+ a char-method map/filter case).
      **Verified:** 280 JS unit tests green (23 suites, 0 fail); String.map + string-method-gaps cross-backend
      green on all 3 backends; direct node probe matches interp byte-for-byte. Residual (BUGS.md): a char
      *literal*'s `.toInt` (`'5'.toInt`) still diverges (literals stay strings to avoid literal-pattern
      `===` codegen) — separate, lower-value follow-up.
- [x] **rust-web-example** ✓ DONE 2026-06-21 (a55e101f2) — added `examples/rust/web-signals.ssc`
      (signal + computedSignal + signalText + serve), emit-rust + `cargo build` green, binary serves SSR and
      `/__ssc/push?name=locale&value=de` recomputes the computed signal (`{"__c0":"fr"}` → `{"__c0":"de"}`).
      Building it (vs the string-match tests, which never cargo-build) surfaced + fixed **two real bugs**:
      (1) computed move-closure use-after-move (cargo E0382) — `renderClosure` now clone-captures read signal
      locals; new regression test, backendRust 228/0; (2) docs showed `POST /__ssc/push -d` but the endpoint
      reads query params `?name=&value=` — corrected example + rust-backend.md + user-guide.md.
- [x] **real-workload-perf** (roadmap-next #1) ✓ DONE 2026-06-20 (all three axes). **(a) cold-start:**
      `tests/perf/coldstart/` + AppCDS in `bin/ssc`/`install.sh` → **378 → 182 ms (−51%)**, peak RSS −32%.
      **(b)+(c) steady-state RSS + GC:** `tests/perf/serverrss/` boots a real server under load → interp
      server **~195 MB RSS, STABLE** (no leak), light GC (~41 pauses/27 ms). Long minutes-scale leak-hunt
      left to demand (`secs=300+`). BACKLOG `real-workload-perf`.
- [x] **xbackend-property-equivalence (full + CI)** ✓ DONE 2026-06-20 — broaden was already complete (12
      kinds incl. effects/Option/Either/closures/nested; node leg 74 programs / 0 skipped) so the work was
      reconciling that + **wiring into CI**: added Node.js setup to the `sbt` job so the interp==JS
      differential now runs in CI (it was skipping). Made hang-safe first (next item). BACKLOG `xbackend-property-equivalence`.
- [x] **xbackend-test-hardening** ✓ DONE 2026-06-20 — root cause was NOT bloop per se: `runProc` read
      subprocess streams with blocking `mkString` BEFORE the bounded `awaitExit`, so a wedged child parked
      the read forever (and could pipe-buffer-deadlock). Fixed via `ProcTestUtil.runCaptured` (threaded
      stream drain + hard timeout that actually fires); `ProcTestUtilTest` proves a `sleep 60`@2s returns
      <15s + a stderr flood doesn't deadlock. `CrossBackendPropertyTest.runProc` delegates. (~9 other test
      files share the old antipattern but run fixed small programs — follow-up sweep, lower risk.)
- [x] **rust-web-toolkit finish** ✓ VERIFIED ESSENTIALLY COMPLETE 2026-06-20 (the "~56 cargo errors" was
      badly stale). Checked against the authoritative signal: **`backendRust` 221/0**, **`RustGenWebToolkitTest`
      17/17** green. Per `specs/rust-web-toolkit.md`: cargo `build` of the std/ui crate is **290 → 0** (whole
      toolkit compiles on Rust), **S4** named/curried args DONE, **S5a** (SSR initial value) + **S5b.1** (local
      client reactivity) + **S5b.2 A/B/C** (generic push / rozum bridge / computed-derived) all DELIVERED at
      poll-transport depth. **REMAINING = explicitly-deferred refinements**, NOT bounded build work: SSE/WS
      streaming transport, client recompute of computed signals, set/toggle/show client wiring, direct-WS
      client. All are **browser-dependent** (can't verify autonomously without a browser) and **rozum-driven**
      (spec method: "drive from the target … ultimately `rozum-web.ssc`"). Hand back to the rozum driver; do
      NOT push speculative client-JS refinements onto `feature/rust-web-toolkit` (rozum's active branch).


- [x] **meta-v2-track-c** ✓ DONE 2026-06-18 (verified, no build needed) — Track C is COMPLETE. C1
      (multi-clause inline) ✓ done 2026-06-18. C2's high-value slice ✓ already done + wired:
      `MacroCodegen.codegenWarnings(module)` is computed in `ssc check` (`Main.scala:5265`, merged into
      `CheckResult.errors:5267`) and warns up-front on interpreter-only macros that can't compile to JVM/JS —
      `MacroCodegenTest` 6/6 green. The remaining C2 ambition (run the Typer over *arbitrary* macro-expanded
      source, map type-errors to `.ssc` positions) is **DEFERRED by design** in the spec: needs a position
      map (re-parse loses positions) + risks false positives (Typer may not grok expanded macro-runtime
      constructs), niche audience — low ROI vs the codegen warning that covers the real failure mode. Building
      it now = busywork against the spec's own judgment. **→ Next pick: sbt-plugin-finish.**
- [~] **sbt-plugin-finish** (roadmap #4, Phase 5) — **dep-resolution ✓ DONE 2026-06-18**: the concrete
      actionable Phase 5 slice. `SscFrontMatter` lifts `.ssc` front-matter `dependencies:` `dep:` Maven
      coords into `sscManagedDependencies` → `libraryDependencies` (Java `%`, Scala-cross `%%`, local paths
      ignored); scripted `dep-resolution/` + full scripted suite green (9). Spec §3h/Phase 5 reconciled.
      **`sscBackends` cross-build ✓ DONE 2026-06-18** (user picked spec open-Q #2 → design A = parallel
      outputs in one `compile`): `sscBackends: Seq[String]` (default `Seq(sscBackend)`); `sscCompile` forks
      `ssc build --backend <b>` per backend — single = flat dir (backward-compat), multiple = per-backend
      subdirs. Scripted `cross-build/`; full suite green (10). RESIDUALS (NOT done): (a) LSP/BSP "polish" —
      `BspIntegration`/`sscBspSetup` already landed Phase 4, no concrete remaining deliverable; (b) Maven
      Central publish + Plugin Portal — Maven-gated (LAST). So the only buildable remainder here is
      Maven-gated.
- [x] **wasm-effects** ✓ COMPLETE 2026-06-20 — additive, wasm-only.
      **arithmetic ✓ DONE (slice 2a):** `_binOp` (+`_bigIntOp`/`_bigDecOp`) — `a + b`/`sum * 2` over effect-op
      results link + run (test → 40). **`_dispatch` ✓ DONE (slice 2b):** collection HOFs on `Any` —
      `xs.map(..).filter(..).head` in a handler links + runs (test → 6); copied the pure subset of `_dispatch`
      + `_seqX`/`_seq`/`_isFree`, reflection fallback → clear error. **multi-shot ✓ DONE (slice 2c):** did NOT
      need a `_handle` rewrite (probe disproved it) — just the pure `_anyFlatMap` helper + a `usesEffects` fix
      to recognise `multi effect Foo:`; NonDet `{1,2}×{10,20}` runs on node (test → 4). **cross-module ✓ DONE
      (slice 2d, no code change):** an imported `effect` already works — `generateUserOnly` resolves imports via
      `baseDir`; run test → `hello\nworld`. **`@main` args/non-Unit edge ✓ DONE (wasm-main-edge):** effectful
      `@main` wrappers preserve Scala 3 main parameter clauses, discard non-Unit returns, and reject invalid raw
      `Array[String]` args clearly. **Complete:** common + advanced cases all run; `WasmBackendTest` 40/40 green.
      BACKLOG `wasm-effects`.
- [x] **build-registry-phase4** ✓ ASSESSED → no action 2026-06-18 (demand-driven). Surveyed the ~24
      `*Registry` classes: they are domain-distinct (Preprocessor / Interpolator / Backend / Capability /
      Route / Command / GlueClasspath / GlueJsPreamble / …), each registering a different kind of thing —
      **not** a duplicated template. The closest pairs (`Glue*`, `Interpolator*`) are small and cohesive;
      consolidating them would be speculative refactoring, exactly what the spec's "only where they remove
      real duplication" guard rules out. No concrete duplication target → no build. Revisit only if one
      appears. (Phases 1–2 landed; Phase 3 moot/load-bearing.)

---

- [~] **rust-web-toolkit** (external driver: rozum) — bring the declarative std/ui toolkit
      (`vstack/heading/text` → `lower(theme)` → `View` → `serve(view, port)`), which works on JVM,
      up on the **Rust** backend via an HTML/SSR binding (operator path A; native GUI rejected as
      too costly). **DONE 2026-06-19:** I1 `s"…${expr}…"` splices + S1a HTML/SSR View primitives
      (`element/textNode/fragment` → `runtime/ui.rs`, gated) + S1b `renderHtml` SSR — `textNode`/
      `fragment` compile AND run end-to-end (`renderHtml(...)` → escaped HTML via `ssc run-rust`).
      `backendRust` 211/0. + S1c `element` (`->` → tuple; non-empty `Map(k->v)` → HashMap-insert;
      `_ui_element` key-sorted attrs) — `renderHtml(element("div",Map("class"->"root"),…))` →
      `<div class="root" …>…</div>` end-to-end, `backendRust` 212/0. + S2 `serve(view, port)` SSR
      overload (`_ui_serve` in `http.rs`, gated on uiUsage) — `curl :8099` → SSR'd HTML, proven
      end-to-end, `backendRust` 214/0. + S1d void elements (`<meta>` self-close) + **capstone
      `examples/ssr-page.ssc`**: full nested HTML page built from primitives → `ssc build-rust` →
      `curl :8123` returns the SSR'd page. **The Rust-SSR web goal is reachable today via primitives.**
      + **S3 (a–k) the std/ui library now CODEGEN-transpiles** (import inliner + block exprs +
      partial fns + patterns + placeholder `_`-lambdas + varargs type + `++`/try/null + struct
      field types + String-match `.as_str()` + opaque-type mapping + signal SSR stubs). Cascade:
      codegen 28→11→6→3→**0**; cargo 290→170→108→70→**56**. **REMAINING:** a finicky cargo
      type-reconciliation tail (~56: TkNode/i64 + String/Value + struct-field i64 + curried-vararg
      **call-site** `vec![]` wrapping + `defaultTheme` val) — converging, multi-session. Then S4
      named/curried args · S5 signal reactivity (stubs are static-only). Spec `specs/rust-web-toolkit.md`.

- [x] **agent-sdk-remainder** ✓ DONE 2026-06-17 (actionable scope) — consolidated `specs/agent-sdk.md`
      + **P3a MCP bridge both directions** (`runtime/std/agent-mcp.ssc`: `serveAgentToolsMcp` +
      `mcpToolSource`; examples `agent-mcp-{server,toolsource}.ssc`; all `ssc check` OK). Loop
      conformance already covered by `AgentSdkInterpreterTest`. DEFERRED (reasons in spec): bridge
      round-trip test (heavy jvm/js infra for thin glue), golden transcripts, P3b embedded (blocked
      on rozum `rozum-embed`). spec `specs/agent-sdk.md`. → **Next: package-registry.**

- [x] **package-registry** (roadmap #3) ✓ DONE 2026-06-17 — found ALREADY BUILT (spec was stale):
      `ssc search`/`info`/`add` over `RegistryClient` (URL-priority + 1h-TTL cache + `--refresh`) +
      seed `registry/packages.yaml`. spec `specs/arch-registry.md` reconciled. Added the minor
      `--offline` flag (cached-only search, `RegistryClient.loadOffline()`). REMAINING (external only):
      the `scalascript/registry` GitHub repo + Pages HTML + validate/publish CI.

- [x] **sbt-plugin-finish** ✓ ACTIONABLE SCOPE DONE 2026-06-18 — this duplicate open marker was stale.
      Front-matter `dependencies:` → Coursier and `sscBackends` cross-build are done + scripted-tested;
      LSP/BSP Phase 4 already landed with no concrete remaining deliverable. Publishing the plugin artifact
      itself is the deferred Maven Central / sbt Plugin Portal step and remains excluded from autonomous work.

- [~] **metaprogramming-v2** (roadmap #5) — AUDIT 2026-06-17: NOT a from-scratch build. All three
      phases have working bases (P3 Linker `inlineTable`/`expandInlineSource`; P4 `${impl('x)}` + direct
      `'{ $x+1 }` + interp parity + `MacroImpl` IR; P5 runtime `Mirror` + user `derived(m: Mirror)`).
      Remaining = the "Planned" extension bullets, broken into small slices in `specs/arch-metaprogramming-v2.md`
      §4b. PROGRESS: **Track A** (P5 cross-backend derives conformance) ✓ DONE (A1a/b/c + A2 + A3,
      2026-06-17; only deferred edge cases remain — sum-type/enum mirrors, generics, mixed-derives clauses).
      **Track B** (P4 const-folding `Expr.asValue match`): **B1 + B2 ✓ DONE 2026-06-18** (interp splice
      unwraps `Expr(v)`; `Linker.expandMacroSource` const-folds literal args to the `Some` branch, else the
      `None` direct quote; `LinkerRewriteTest` +7 / `InlineDerivesTest`; `examples/quoted-macro-constfold.ssc`).
      **B3 ✓ DONE 2026-06-18 — JVM + JS** (was blocked — quoted macros were interpreter-only): the
      `macro-codegen-backends` pass (`MacroCodegen.expand`, hooked into `JvmGen` + `JsGen` generate entry
      points) expands + strips macros pre-codegen, no-op for macro-free modules;
      `QuotedMacroJvmConformanceTest` (scala-cli) + `QuotedMacroJsConformanceTest` (node) match interp.
      **Track B is complete (B1+B2+B3).** **Track C:** C1 (multi-clause inline) ✓ DONE 2026-06-18
      (curry tail clauses into the body — no scanner/wire change); **C2** (post-expansion re-typecheck +
      source-positioned errors) is the last open meta-v2 slice. Days-per-slice. Spec Status corrected from
      stale "deferred/planning".

### Tier 2 — AUDIT 2026-06-17: most "themes" are already BUILT (specs stale)

While pulling these in I audited each against the code — and like agent-sdk + package-registry,
most are already implemented; the specs/BACKLOG were stale. So Tier 2 is mostly **reconcile +
verify residuals**, NOT from-scratch builds:

**RECONCILED 2026-06-18 (`tier2-spec-reconcile`)** — verified each theme against the code:
- [x] **theme-f-dsl-platform-hooks** — spec Status already accurate ("implemented through Phase 4",
      `InterpolatorRegistry`). No change needed.
- [x] **theme-h-library-modularity** — spec Status already accurate ("implemented through Phase 6",
      `SsclibManifest`). No change needed.
- [x] **theme-j-lightweight-ffi** — ✓ DONE: `@jvm`/`@js` (Phases 1–4) + `@rust` + **`@wasm`** all wired.
      The WASM backend exists (`runtime/backend/wasm`, Scala.js → `.wasm`); `WasmGen` lowers `@wasm("expr")`
      externs to a `def` (2026-06-18, `WasmBackendTest`). Only `@wasmExport`/`@wasmImport` (raw WASM ABI)
      stay out of scope **by design** (the Scala.js path owns the ABI). The "no WASM backend wiring" note
      was stale.
- [~] **theme-a-stable-plugin-spi** — spec Status accurate ("partially implemented"; Phases 1+2 landed).
      Residual = Phase 3 versioned stable API module. Left as-is (accurate).
- [x] **ssc-new-audit** ✓ DONE 2026-06-19 — verified and tightened the local `ssc new` /
      standalone-install surface without touching Maven/publication. Fixed `NewProject.create` to best-effort
      `git init -q`; fixed `ssc new` usage to list all bundled templates; made root `install.sh` match docs
      (`./install.sh` prints standalone Coursier/Homebrew/curl guidance, `./install.sh --dev` runs monorepo
      staging); clarified `specs/arch-ssc-new.md` (plugin template intentionally has no `project/plugins.sbt`;
      live channel publication remains deferred); updated the old benchmark note to use `install.sh --dev`.
      Added tests for all six templates, output-dir aliases, placeholder-free rendering, git-init, and release
      fixtures. Verify: `cd /Users/sergiy/work/my/scalascript/.worktrees/feature/ssc-new-audit && sbt
      "cli/testOnly scalascript.cli.NewProjectTest scalascript.cli.StandaloneInstallFixturesTest"` → 8/8 green.
- [x] **board-ledger-hygiene** ✓ DONE 2026-06-19 — docs-only cleanup. Marked the duplicate
      `sbt-plugin-finish` open item as actionable-scope done/Maven-gated, and removed three stale
      `Status: open` lines inside fixed `BUGS.md` entries (`jvmgen-multishot-handle-result-any`,
      `jvmgen-handle-in-arg-position`, `js-self-handling-cps-fn-not-run`). Verify:
      `git grep -n "\*\*Status:\*\* open\|Status: open" -- BUGS.md` → no matches, and
      `git grep -n "^- \[ \] \*\*sbt-plugin-finish" -- SPRINT.md` → no matches.
- [x] **theme-b-build-registry-consolidation** — Phase 3 is **MOOT** (triaged 2026-06-18):
      `PluginManifest`/`LocalRegistry` are the **implementation** the facade is built on (not removable
      wrappers — `BackendRegistry` uses `PluginManifest`; `ImportResolver`/`PluginCommands` use
      `LocalRegistry`), and `isStdPluginInterpreterTest` is already gone. Nothing to remove. OPTIONAL
      Phase 4 (family registries) remains, demand-driven.
- [x] **module-graph-grouping** — ✓ INVESTIGATED → leave-as-is (2026-06-18, `docs/module-graph-findings.md`):
      197 modules; the per-impl module IS the SPI boundary; grouping either collapses it or is a no-op on
      the graph. No action.
- [ ] **std-nfc-packager-adapters** — BLOCKED autonomously: needs real iOS/Android/Web-NFC packager
      integration + device/browser harnesses. Native platform follow-up; can't verify without targets.
- [ ] **wallet-browser-ws-itest** — BLOCKED autonomously: real browser-WebSocket integration; full run
      needs a browser.

**Genuine remaining BUILD work** (across Tiers): `sbt-plugin-finish` Phase 5 (dep-resolution wiring +
Maven publish — publish is Maven-gated), `build-registry` Phase 3 cleanup + optional Phase 4 (Phases 1–2
landed), `metaprogramming-v2` — NOT large/from-scratch: all 3 phases have working bases; remaining =
the §4b slice tracks (A: P5 cross-backend conformance [first], B: P4 const-fold, C: P3 robustness),
days-per-slice. + the small residuals above. See BACKLOG "Roadmap reality check".

### Excluded from the sprint (deferred / blocked — stay in BACKLOG, NOT actionable now)

- **Maven Central + sbt Plugin Portal** (roadmap #8 / Theme C) — LAST, explicit-go only.
- **direct-style-eval** — DEFERRED, data-disproven ("do not start").
- **hof-glue-jit-compile**, **vectorize-pure-loop** — deferred perf (sub-15% ceiling / speculative SIMD).
- **agent P3b embedded transport** — blocked on rozum shipping the `rozum-embed` crate.
- **WalletConnect project-ID** — blocked on an external decision.
- **Hardware-wallet Vault (Ledger)**, **MPC Vault** — need real hardware / external SDKs; can't verify autonomously.
