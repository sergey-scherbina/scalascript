# Sprint

Agent task queue — **active pending tasks only**. A task is "available" only if
`.work/active/<slug>.claim` does not exist on `origin/main`. Completed work lives in
`CHANGELOG.md`; open (not-yet-started) work lives in `BACKLOG.md`.

**Loop control** — pause: push `.work/paused` to `origin/main`; resume: remove it and push.
Start: tell the agent "go" / "работай". Status: ask "status" / "статус".

## Active tasks

Strategic-review proposals (2026-06-15) — the feature roadmap is built out; leverage has shifted from
building features to validating/hardening/enabling what exists. Work top-to-bottom.

- [ ] **rozum-live-conformance** — Add an opt-in live conformance check against a real
      adjacent Rust `rozum` OpenAI-compatible gateway. HOW: create/extend a focused
      spec before code; inspect `../rozum/docs/specs/integration.md` and
      `../rozum/docs/specs/agent-sdk.md` plus gateway examples/tests; add a
      skipped-by-default interpreter plugin test gated by `ROZUM_BASE_URL` and
      `ROZUM_MODEL` (optional `ROZUM_AUTH_TOKEN`) that exercises `std.agent` against
      `/v1/chat/completions` without requiring CI to run rozum. Done when the no-env
      test path skips cleanly, the opt-in command is documented, and the spec records
      the exact live env contract.
- [ ] **rozum-agent-streaming** — Add P1 streaming support for rozum/OpenAI-compatible
      chat completions. HOW: spec `AgentEvent`/`AgentStreamResult` first; build on the
      existing `std.http` streaming/SSE surface if present (otherwise queue the missing
      HTTP stream primitive separately); assemble text deltas and tool-call deltas in
      `std.agent` without moving agent-session ownership into rozum. Done when a fake
      SSE fixture covers text streaming, tool-call streaming, stream errors, and max
      step behavior.
- [ ] **rozum-agent-endpoint-pool** — Add optional endpoint pool + retry/failover for
      multiple rozum gateways. HOW: spec config fields and failure semantics first;
      keep the default single-endpoint API stable; retry only transport/5xx failures
      with bounded attempts/backoff and preserve transcript/tool idempotency. Done when
      tests prove fallback order, no retry on model/tool validation errors, and stable
      behavior with one endpoint.
- [ ] **rozum-agent-schema-derivation** — Derive JSON schemas for `AgentTool` handlers
      from typed ScalaScript signatures where possible, leaving explicit schemas as the
      fallback. HOW: spec the supported type subset (`String`, `Int`, `Double`,
      `Boolean`, records, arrays, optionals if available) and rejection behavior for
      unsupported types; keep hand-written schemas authoritative when provided. Done
      when examples show both derived and explicit schemas and tests cover unsupported
      type diagnostics.
- [x] **rozum-integration** ✓ DONE 2026-06-15 — Added `std.agent` P0: app-owned
      OpenAI-compatible tool-call loop for stateless rozum gateways over existing
      `std.http` + `std.json`, with explicit JSON schemas, `AgentTool` handlers,
      transcript JSON, `MaxSteps`, non-2xx `Error`, unknown-tool and handler-validation
      tool-error feedback. Added `examples/rozum-agent.ssc`, README links, and
      `AgentSdkInterpreterTest` (7 cases). Verified with
      `cd /Users/sergiy/work/my/scalascript/.worktrees/feature/rozum-integration && sbt "backendInterpreterPluginTests/testOnly scalascript.AgentSdkInterpreterTest"`.
      Commits: spec `08f03f18f`, implementation `fce51c2e6`, verify/docs
      `2290e95bf`. ORIGINAL — Add ScalaScript integration with the adjacent Rust `rozum`
      app, following `../rozum/integration.md` and `../rozum/sdk.md`. HOW: read the
      rozum docs first, write and commit `specs/rozum-integration.md`, then implement
      the smallest ScalaScript surface that matches the documented SDK/integration
      contract. Keep any new user-facing APIs under `std.*` and implement required
      intrinsics in a `runtime/std/<feature>-plugin/` plugin, not interpreter core.
      Add a runnable `examples/` script and focused tests. Done when the example and
      relevant sbt tests pass from the worktree with explicit `cd`.
- [x] **compile-time-at-scale** ✓ DONE 2026-06-15 — measured parse/type/jvmGen/jsGen across N=50→6400 defs: frontend LINEAR, codegen ~linear+mild tail, NO O(n²); 6400-def module compiles <0.5s. Added CompileScaleBench guard + docs/compile-scale-findings.md. ORIGINAL — every compile/codegen bench uses TINY inputs (6-line
      programs; jvmgen-codegen-time −94% was on those). Compile-time at REAL scale is UNMEASURED. HOW:
      build a large-program compile-time bench (generate a big synthetic `.ssc` — many defs/blocks/types
      and/or a deep import chain), profile parser/typer/normalize/codegen scaling vs input size, find any
      O(n²) hotspot. Fix if a clear one exists (A/B); else ship the scaling profile + a guard bench as the
      deliverable. This is the real perf frontier now that micro-perf is at floor.
- [x] **xbackend-property-equivalence** ✓ SLICE 1 DONE 2026-06-15 — CrossBackendPropertyTest generates core Int programs (arith/val/if/fns) from seeds + asserts interp==JS(node) over 40 + interp==JVM(scala-cli) over 5; all agree (core holds). Harness extensible; broadening (ADTs/match/effects) + overflow dimension = BACKLOG full-suite. ORIGINAL (slice 1) — harden the core "one source, many targets" guarantee:
      a property/fuzz test that GENERATES small programs over a core expression/stmt subset and asserts
      `interp output == jvm == js`. Start bounded (arithmetic, lets, if/match, simple functions); reuse the
      existing 127-case conformance harness + the ~70 property/fuzz test files as scaffolding. Each found
      divergence is a real cross-backend bug. Grows the conformance guarantee from fixed cases to generated.

_See BACKLOG.md "Strategic-review proposals" for the broader/deferred items (real-workload perf, registry, demand-driven)._ Tidied 2026-06-15 — the sprint was a backlog of already-completed work (autonomous
batches, busi fixes, JIT stages, rust/std milestones, the 4 architecture refinements, the
effect-vm-continuations performance thread). All of it has shipped and is recorded in
`CHANGELOG.md` + git history. Pick the next item from `BACKLOG.md` (open `[ ]` items) or take
a fresh direction.
