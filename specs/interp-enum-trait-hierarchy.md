# Interpreter — enum → trait hierarchy resolution (busi seq-120 / seq-121 / seq-124-125)

**Status:** implemented 2026-06-12 (same-file); cross-module follow-up 2026-06-12.
**Source:** busi rozum seq-120 + seq-121 (same-file), seq-124 + seq-125 (cross-module).

## Cross-module follow-up (busi seq-124 / seq-125)

The same-file fix did not cover busi's real layout — types declared in one module,
values/calls in another via `[name](path)`. Two further gaps (one per symptom):

- **Trait methods not merged across imports (seq-125).** The import merge propagated
  `parentTypes`, `typeFieldOrder`, … but **not** `typeMethods`, so a concrete method
  on an imported trait (`e.kind`) was absent on instances of imported enum-cases
  (`No field 'kind'`). Fix: `Interpreter.exportedTypeMethods` + a per-type union
  merge in `SectionRuntime` next to the `parentTypes` merge.
- **JIT type-test against a supertype is exact-match (seq-124).** `parentTypes` *is*
  merged across imports, so the **tree-walk** type-test already worked cross-module;
  but a function like `eventIsCore(e) = e match { case _: CoreEvent => … }` gets
  **JIT-compiled**, and the JIT lowers `case _: T` to a switch on the **exact** type
  tag/name — which can never see a subtype instance, so it returned `false`. (This is
  a *general* JIT gap for any JIT'd supertype type-test; it only surfaced
  cross-module because there the matcher function gets compiled — same-file matchers
  in `main` run once and never JIT.) Fix: both JIT backends (`JavacJitBackend`,
  `AsmJitBackend`) **bail to tree-walk** when any match arm type-tests a supertype (a
  type that appears as a value in `parentTypes`, i.e. has descendants); the tree-walk
  path walks the parent chain correctly. Leaf-type type-tests still JIT.

Regression: `EnumTraitCrossModuleTest` (2-file — type-test `true` + `a.kind`
`k:1000`), run with the JIT **on** (default), so it actually exercises the compiled
path the same-file `BugReproTest` cases do not.

## JIT supertype type-test — real compile (follow-up to the seq-124 bail)

The seq-124 fix **bailed** the JIT to tree-walk on `case _: Supertype` (correct, but
loses JIT speed for supertype-narrowing dispatch — exactly busi's 168-variant `Event`
hierarchy). This follow-up makes it a **real compile** on the default (`JavacJitBackend`):

- New `JitGlobals.isSubtype(typeName, target)` — a runtime parent-chain test against
  the current interpreter's `parentTypes` (thread-local). Lets JIT'd code narrow by a
  (possibly imported) supertype without expanding subtype arms at compile time.
- A match with a supertype `case _: T` arm now routes to the **if-chain** path (both
  the statement form `walkMatchBody` and the expression form `walkMatchExpr`), and
  `walkArmAsIfBranch` gained a `Pat.Typed` case that emits the right condition: a
  **supertype** → `JitGlobals.isSubtype(inst.typeName(), "T")`; a **leaf** type →
  the exact `inst.typeTag()==tag` / `"T".equals(inst.typeName())`. The if-chain
  preserves Scala first-match order, so a leaf arm before a supertype arm still wins
  (no dedup / case-collision problem the switch-arm-expansion approach would have).
- `AsmJitBackend` keeps the seq-124 **bail** (correct via tree-walk); upgrading it to
  a real compile is a separate follow-up — Javac is the default backend.

Regression: 3 hot-loop (`50k`-call) `BugReproTest` cases (statement form, expression
form, leaf-before-supertype ordering) + a `JitLintTest` assertion that the supertype
matcher reports `willJit == true` on Javac (it bailed before this change).

## Problem

The interpreter records type ancestry in a single-parent chain
`interp.parentTypes: Map[String, String]`, walked by runtime type-tests
(`PatternRuntime`, `case _: T`) and method dispatch (`DispatchRuntime`). Three gaps
broke resolution through an `enum case → enum → (intermediate) trait → trait`
hierarchy:

1. **Enum/trait own-parent not recorded.** `Defn.Enum` recorded only `case → enum`
   and `Defn.Trait` recorded nothing, so the chain broke at the enum/trait.
   `case _: TaxEvent` on a `PolishTaxEvent.PolishVatConfigured` value returned
   `false` — the walk from the case reached the enum and stopped (seq-120).
2. **Trait concrete methods not registered.** A `def kind = …` body on a trait
   went nowhere (only abstract `Decl.Def`s were collected, for remoteStub). So
   `e.kind` on an enum-case instance raised `No field 'kind'` (seq-121).
3. **Dispatch never walked the parent chain for `typeMethods`** — it checked only
   the exact type — and **`this` (`Term.This`) was unimplemented** (`Cannot eval:
   Term.This`), so even a found trait method whose body uses `this match { … }`
   could not run.

## Fix

- **`StatRuntime`** — `recordFirstParent(name, inits, interp)` records the first
  declared supertype for **enums and traits** (it already happened for classes), so
  the chain is `case → enum → trait → trait`. `Defn.Trait` now also registers its
  **concrete** `Defn.Def` methods into `interp.typeMethods(traitName)`.
- **`DispatchRuntime`** — `lookupTypeMethod(typeName, name)` walks the
  `parentTypes` chain checking each `typeMethods(t)`; used in the member-dispatch
  fallback **after** instance-field resolution (so a field shadows an inherited
  method) for both the no-arg (`e.kind`) and with-args (`e.m(a)`) paths.
  `invokeTypeMethod` binds `this` to the receiver when the body references it.
- **`Interpreter`** — `methodUsesThis(body)` is a body-keyed (IdentityHashMap)
  cache so the `this`-binding `fields.updated("this", recv)` allocation is paid
  only by methods that actually use `this`; the common path is unchanged.
- **`EvalRuntime`** — `Term.This` evaluates to the bound `this` (or a located
  error outside a method body).
- Type-test resolution (`PatternRuntime`) is unchanged — it already walked
  `parentTypes`; gap #1 simply completed the chain it walks.

## Behaviour checklist

- [x] `case _: IntermediateTrait` matches an enum-case value through the chain.
- [x] `case _: TopTrait` / `case _: Enum` also match (each level of the chain).
- [x] a concrete method on a sealed trait dispatches on enum-case / case-class
      instances of subtypes, no-arg and with args.
- [x] `this` resolves to the receiver inside a class/enum/trait method body.
- [x] an instance **field** shadows an inherited method of the same name.
- [x] full `backendInterpreter` suite green (1654) — central dispatch path touched.
